- 👋 Hi, I’m @jnolen77
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers. I used to design websites over 20 years ago using html and a little CSS. I went into the restaurant industry and have been
- working as a chef ever since.
- Now I'm looking to change careers. I've always loved the problem solving that comes with programming. I am currently a culinary director overseeing 5 restaurants
- and know that my experience can translate to project management. My job has been to oversee a team of sous chefs, cooks, dishwasher, food runners, and others in the
- succesful operations of many restaurants. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, css, and javascript. I plan on learning more as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything beginner friendly in python, html, css, or javascript.
- 📫 How to reach me. You can reach me at dev.nolen@gmail.com
